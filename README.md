## How to Use Woo2Test

There are two options for using Woo2Test:

### Option 1: Import a Library

Use the Woo2Test instance deployed by me ([david@ubiquae.com](mailto:david@ubiquae.com)). This is the simplest option, but note that the service cannot be guaranteed, and you won't be able to execute your own code.

#### Instructions:

1.  Import Woo2Test as a library using the ID: `1n-kjtsY2j3Lzh4vCbeEWwnmARoBDtIiMZbH0ediyZkRgNVfCHEBMxxv4`.
2.  [Setup your Google Sheet](https://chat.openai.com/c/60cc0b61-b952-4ac4-a3ae-a39a30543518#how-to-setup-your-own-google-sheet-to-gather-data-from-woocommerce).

### Option 2: Create Your Own Library

1.  Clone the code and create your own Google App Script project.
2.  Deploy the code as a library and copy the ID.
3.  Import Woo2Test as a library using the newly generated ID.
4.  [Setup your Google Sheet](https://chat.openai.com/c/60cc0b61-b952-4ac4-a3ae-a39a30543518#how-to-setup-your-own-google-sheet-to-gather-data-from-woocommerce).

## How to Setup Your Own Google Sheet to Gather Data from WooCommerce

1.  Create your Google Sheet File.
2.  Open App Script and paste the given code.
3.  Add `appscript.json` (navigate to settings and enable the "Show App Script" option).
4.  Set up the `CONFIG` object with the relevant information like your spreadsheet ID and the API keys you generated in WooCommerce.

## Code Snippet

The following is a sample Google App Script code snippet to set up the `CONFIG` object and Google Sheet menu.
